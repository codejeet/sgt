# Modulo — Cold Calling Script (Jeremy Miner-inspired)

Goal: book a short demo with the decision maker (practice manager/owner), without sounding like a pitch.

## Preparation
Have ready:
- 2-sentence description
- 2 outcomes (time saved, fewer missing forms)
- 1 proof point: “Used across 23 clinics internally” (if true and permitted)

## Call structure
### 1) Permission-based opener (disarms)
> “Hi — this is {{NAME}}. Did I catch you in the middle of something?”

If yes:
> “Totally—can I take 20 seconds to tell you why I called, and then you can tell me if it’s worth scheduling something, fair?”

If no:
> “Great—can I take 20 seconds to tell you why I called, and then you can tell me if it’s worth scheduling something?”

### 2) Neutral reason for call (no hype)
> “We help pediatric clinics reduce check‑in paperwork and staff rework by sending intake packets by text before the visit—so forms are completed on the patient’s phone and your team can track completion.”

### 3) Problem-centric question (make them think)
Pick one:
- > “How are you handling intake paperwork today—mostly clipboards and scanning, or digital forms?”
- > “When patients show up without forms done, what usually happens—do they fill them in the lobby, or does staff chase them later?”

### 4) Label + explore (Jeremy Miner vibe)
If they describe pain:
> “Sounds like that creates a lot of rework.”
> “What does that cost you in a typical week—time, delays, frustrated parents?”

If they say “we’re fine”:
> “That’s good. Just so I’m not wasting your time—what’s the part of intake that’s still a little annoying, if anything?”

### 5) Mini-contrast (create curiosity)
> “The reason I ask is most clinics we talk to either (a) have forms but completion is inconsistent, or (b) the forms are digital but hard to maintain and staff still ends up chasing missing fields.”
> “Which one is closer to your world?”

### 6) Book the demo (low-pressure)
> “If we could show you a simple flow—text link → patient completes → staff sees completion—would it be crazy to do a 15‑minute look sometime this week?”

If they ask price too early:
> “Happy to cover that—before price, can I ask one quick question so I know if this is even relevant?”

### 7) Qualification questions (fast)
- “About how many providers and locations?”
- “Roughly how many patient visits per week?”
- “Do you already text patients reminders?”
- “Who besides you would weigh in if you liked what you saw?”

### 8) Close the next step (calendar)
> “Would Tuesday morning or Thursday afternoon be better?”

## Objection handling
### “Send info”
> “Sure—quick question: when you say ‘send info’, is it because you’re interested but want to review first, or you’re not sure it applies?”

Then:
> “If I send a 60‑second video showing the flow, would you be open to a 10‑minute call after you watch it?”

### “We already have forms / EHR portal”
> “Makes sense. Usually the portal exists, but completion before arrival is the issue.”
> “How often do patients complete everything before they walk in?”

### “No budget”
> “Totally. If you could wave a magic wand—what would intake look like so it wasn’t a headache?”

### “Is this HIPAA compliant?”
Be honest:
> “We don’t position this as fully HIPAA compliant yet. Current baseline includes encryption in transit/at rest, access controls, and audit logs. We are still finishing full BAA coverage and formal policy documentation. Where are you drawing the line internally for vendors touching PHI?”

(Do not claim compliance if it’s not true.)

## Voicemail (10 seconds)
> “Hi {{NAME}}, this is {{NAME}}. We help pediatric clinics reduce intake paperwork by sending mobile forms via text before visits. If you’re the right person, call/text me at {{NUMBER}}—or I’ll try you again tomorrow.”

---

## Follow-up SMS (if appropriate)
> “Hi {{NAME}}—{{NAME}} here. Quick question: are you still doing paper intake forms at check-in, or mostly digital? (Trying to see if this is relevant.)”
